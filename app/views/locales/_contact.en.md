Got an awesome idea? [Apply for a grant!](<%= new_submission_path %>)

To reach a specific chapter, please use the e-mail link at the top of the chapter's page, under the Chapters section of this site. Or, for general global inquiries, you can drop us a line at contact@awesomefoundation.org (we are unable to provide updates or feedback with regard to applications at this address). You can also connect with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/awesomefound) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/awesomefoundation).

If you're interested in starting your own chapter, which involves assembling a group of at least ten "trustees" willing to each contribute $100 (or the local equivalent) every month toward the grant, please get in touch at join@awesomefoundation.org.
